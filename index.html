            <p>
    <b>I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University!</b><br><br>
    Over the course of my college career, I've discovered I love to combine digital media and computer engineering. I spent eight months on an internship making tutorial videos, teaching viewers how to use different aspects of their very technical software. When I returned to school that fall, I learned how to 3D model. I would love to combine making videos and 3D modeling to teach, but in the mean time, I am focusing on programming websites. I hope to find a web developer internship for the summer!
    <br> 
    <br> A little bit about me; I really love reading (I love science fiction and fantasy), playing video games and the guitar. I also love to play soccer. If I'm not doing one of those things, I'm probably programming. The web-based languages are my favorite (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). My hopes and dreams include traveling abroad, getting a job after graduation and finally beating my little brother at Mario Kart. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    This website is my portfolio (also my CprE 494 portfolio) and a side project of mine. It was coded from scratch using validated HTML5 and CSS, and I will continue to edit it in my free time. You can find the code for it on<a href="https://github.com/Schillysrh">Github!</a>

            <p><b>Senior Design Project (CprE 491)</b></p>
            <div class = "projbreak"></div>
            <p>
                <center><a href="http://dec1509.sd.ece.iastate.edu/">3D Reconstruction using Time of Flight Sensors</a></center>
            </p><p>
                This semester, Spring 15, I began my senior design project. It is in the earliest stages, and this section will be updated as the semester goes on. The client for this project is VirtuSense Technologies. 
            <br><br>
                The project description is as follows:
            <br>
                VirtuSense Technologies (VST) intends to explore time-of-flight based technology that resolves distance (depth) based on the known speed of light for 3D surface reconstruction. VST is further interested in developing algorithms to morph shapes of 3D models, using force fields.
                <!-- <img src="img/1aacd6a.png" alt="VirtuSense Technologies"> -->
            <br><br>
                I am the webmaster for the project's website and you can find the project's website linked above!
            <br><br>
                The project's goal is to introduce this 3D technology into the field of plastic surgery. The idea is to create an inexpensive way to take a picture of someone and allow a surgeon to show them on the potential changes on a 3D replica of the face. This can provide an avenue for more input from the patient or even a piece of mind.

            <b>CheckMate: Online Chess Game (ComS 309)</b>
            </p>
            <div class = "projbreak"></div>
            <p>
                CheckMate is an online chess game my team and I chose to create for this course. My role in this project was as the leader. I was in charge of scheduling, due dates and maintaining morale. This project was particularly challenging as it began as a group of four, and ended with three people. Making sure roles and jobs were assigned and taken care of was also on my list of duties. The logo below leads to a poster with all the details of the project.  
                <br><br>
                <a href = "M13_CheckMatePoster.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="img/logo.png" alt = "CheckMate Logo"/></a>
                <br><br>
                We used scrum for our project development process and divided up programming roles. Chess allows for plenty of avenues for development, and the main goal by the end of the semester was to allow person versus person game play, and basic tutorials to teach any user how to play chess. None of the team members new PHP, which was the main language used to create the game.
                <br><br>
                My job was programming all front end parts of the website. I learned how to use PHP to create login and registration forms. My first real dive into HTML and CSS happened during this project. I created all web pages and utilized Javascript to create multiple interactive tutorials. W3Schools, StackOverflow and CodeAcademy were all utilized to familiarize myself with these languages and skills.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>Basic UNIX Shell (CprE 308)</b>
            </p>
            <div class = "projbreak"></div>
            <p>
                Computer Engineering 308 is Operating Systems, Principles and Practices, and probably one of my favorite computer classes at Iowa State. The class centers around teaching about operating systems using UNIX. Not only did I learn about the purpose of an operating system, processes and threads, process scheduling, and deadlocks, but I got to program my own UNIX shell.
            <br><br>
                My experience with C began in the spring of 2012, and that was about all I got. This class allowed me to not only dive deeper into C and use it to make something cool. My shell accepted basic commands and prompts, and created parent and child processes. This project involved a lot of StackOverflow and various resources from other universities (Harvard and Stanford had a lot on the subject) seeing as I knew nothing when I started. But the end result was extremely satisfying and I learned a metric ton of things.
                <!-- <img src="img/UNIX_Shell_Snap.png" alt="UNIX Shell Code" style="height: 400px; width: 500px"> -->

            <b>Measuring and Studying Run Times (ComS 311)</b>
            </p>
            <div class = "projbreak"></div>
            <p>
                Computer Science 311 is the design and analysis of algorithms. Many might consider it to be a personal hell. But nevertheless, extremely important. As the title of the course suggests, the project was the analysis of run times of certain algorithms.
            <br><br>
                QuickSort, InsertionSort and MergeSort were all used in this project, utilizing the Java programming language. The goal was to create arrays of random data and find the largest array size that would yield a run time more than one second. I made worst case and average case running times for each algorithm. To analyze these running times, the size and times for each were graphed and discussed. This process allowed me to really look in depth at each of these sorting algorithms, and their individual strengths and weaknesses. (I hate to admit this, but I actually enjoyed this project quite a lot).

                 During my co-op at Emerson Fisher Controls, I made YouTube videos for the FIELDVUE marketing department. I created tutorials and how-to videos for customers. I currently have fourteen videos on the Fisher Control Valve YouTube Channel, and they have over 8,600 views! Below is one of the videos and the links below lead to some of the other ones.<br></p>

                <p>The co-op was for a marketing position, so when I wasn't making videos I was helping to plan for an international event and learning the tools of the marketing trade. I assisted with FY14 forecasting, creating other learning material for FIELDVUE and other such tasks.

                    <p>The Fall of 2014, I enrolled in two 3D imaging classes. One was a 3D animation course, and the other is a 3D modeling class, both of which I absolutely fell in love with. All the following were done using Cinema 4D and After Effects. 
                        <br><br>
                        The videos came from the 3D animation course. The first is a video about Neptune. The goal was to make a video no longer than 60 seconds, and use a 2D storyboard method to create all aspects of the video. The second is my final project for my 3D animation course, and is a video about how an electric guitar works.
