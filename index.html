            <p class="pg">
    <b>I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University!</b><br><br>
    Over the course of my college career, I've discovered I love to create and teach. Along with Computer Engineering, a Digital Media minor from the college of design lets me do that. I spent eight months on an internship making tutorials, and the Fall of 2014 I learned 3D modeling. I want to combine the two upon graduation.
    <br> 
    <br> A little bit about me; I really dig reading, playing video games and the guitar. I also love to play soccer. If I'm not doing one of those things, I'm probably programming. The web-based languages are my favorite (HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery). My hopes and dreams include traveling abroad, getting a job after graduation and finally beating my little brother at Mario Kart. 
    <br>
    <br> 
    This website is my portfolio and also a side project of mine. It was coded from scratch using validated HTML5 and CSS, and I will continue to edit it in my free time.

                    <p class = "pg">The Fall of 2014, I enrolled in two 3D imaging classes. One is a 3D animation course, and the other is a 3D modeling class. All the following were done using Cinema 4D and After Effects. 
                        <br><br>
                        The videos came from the 3D animation course. The first is a minute long video about Neptune. The second is my final project for my 3D animation course, and is a video about how an electric guitar works.

                 During my co-op at Emerson Fisher Controls, I made YouTube videos for the FIELDVUE marketing department. I created tutorials and how-to videos for customers. I currently have fourteen videos on the Fisher Control Valve YouTube Channel. Below is one of the videos and the links below lead to some of the other ones.<br></p>
